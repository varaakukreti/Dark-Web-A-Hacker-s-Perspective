    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>
        A study which was conducted by Positive Technologiesâ€™ analysts threw light on the fact that 90% of the 
        time, users of dark web forums are searching for hackers who can get them access to a particular resource or 
        for hackers who can hack into a userâ€™s databases and download them. The research showed that 69% of the ads 
        inquired for services for website hacking, where the main purpose was to access a particular web resource. 
        Additionally, 4% ads corresponded to people looking for hackers to infect a web resource with malware & 3% 
        for the ones who could delete data from a website of their choice. Among various hacking services provided 
        on the dark web there is a very high demand for hackers who can gain access to online stores as when paying 
        for items using online transactions users enter their credit card details. Thus, there is an opportunity to 
        inject malicious JavaScript code into the targeted websites which would enable the â€˜bad guysâ€™ to intercept 
        any and all information entered by users, which in turn can be used by the hacker themselves or sold to 
        someone else on the dark web. It is evident from the facts that dark web is a sprawling ground for hackers, 
        not just for finding contracts but also for carrying out the deed itself. What does dark web have to offer 
        hackers? How does internet which specially in todayâ€™s pandemic struck world is helping everyone by enabling 
        them to staying in touch with their loved ones, attending online classes or working from home become the 
        source of something so malicious?
